Now that your git repository is up and running, each morning we will do the following:

git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master

If this is successful, then you will see the new content posted by your instructors.  
I just updated today's warmup with a temporary file.  If you fetch and merge, the new file will show up on your computer.
