{"mission_statement": "Education should \n                be the best investment you make in your future\u2014and at Flatiron School, \n                we\u2019re committed to helping you learn the skills you need to change yours \n                for the better. Online and on our 12 WeWork campuses across the country and \n                in London, we provide the skills, community, and immersive, outcomes-driven \n                curriculum you need to launch a career in Software Engineering, Data Science, \n                or UX/UI Design.\n\nFlatiron School was founded in 2012 by Adam Enbar, \n                a venture capitalist with a passion for education, and Avi Flombaum, \n                a self-taught computer programmer committed to helping his students \n                learn and love code. Adam and Avi came together with a shared mission: \n                to create an alternative education model that provided students with the 21st \n                century tech skills necessary to succeed in a booming tech world, with success \n                tied directly to getting students jobs as software engineers. Alongside a scrappy \n                community of students eager for a new way of learning, \n                Adam and Avi launched Flatiron School \u2013 an accelerated programming school in a \n                small, second-floor walk-up in the Flatiron District of Manhattan that inspired \n                a coding bootcamp industry.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve proven that this model can work \u2013 \n                with nearly all job-seeking graduates  across our programs beginning fulfilling \n                careers at leading companies like Google, Apple, Black Rock, and even NASA. \n                With the launch of our Income Share Agreement (more information here), \n                we\u2019ve sought to break down the high-cost barrier to entry that comes with traditional \n                four-year degrees. And, with our Tuition-back Guarantee, we\u2019ve committed to ensuring \n                you can change careers with confidence. Enroll at Flatiron School, graduate, follow \n                our Career Services commitment, and land a job in 6 months\u2014or your money back \n                (see details here).\n\nOur commitment to expand accessibility and diversity \n                in classrooms and boardrooms doesn\u2019t stop there.  We\u2019ve pushed to increase \n                access to our transformative education by offering scholarships and fellowship \n                programs for underrepresented groups in tech through partnerships with \n                organizations like Facebook, Operation Code, SeatGeek and Out in Tech.\n                \n\nIn 2015, we took our classroom online with Learn.co, our proprietary, \n                gamified online learning platform, expanding access to our programs to people \n                around the world. Now, those previously excluded from the bootcamp model, \n                like people holding full-time jobs, parents balancing packed schedules, \n                students hundreds of miles from the nearest tech hub can now change careers \n                through access to our online programs.\n\nTechnology is reshaping the way we learn, \n                study, and work, and Flatiron School is proud to be at the forefront of this change. \n                And, we\u2019re just getting started.", "software_engineering": {"overview": "With Flatiron School, you\u2019ll learn full-stack development \n                                                   with both Ruby on Rails and Javascript. \n                                                   Our unique rigorous, modern curriculum trains you \n                                                   to think and build like a seasoned developer. \n                                                   Our grads are able to quickly and easily adapt \n                                                   to any development environment.", "mods": {"mod_1": ["Object-Oriented Programming", "SQL"], "mod_2": ["Ruby", "Product Management", "Sinatra"], "mod_3": ["Javascript"], "mod_4": ["React", "Redux"]}}, "data_science": {"overview": "This program will provide you with the knowledge, skills, and experience to get a job as a data scientist \u2013 which\nrequires a mix of software engineering, statistical understanding, and the ability to apply both skills in new and\nchallenging domains.\nOver 15 challenging weeks at Flatiron School, you\u2019ll learn how to gather data, apply statistical analysis to\nanswer questions with that data, and to make your insights and information as actionable as possible.
