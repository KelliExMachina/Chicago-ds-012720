## Lesson Summary:

#### Topic:
Introducing studends to visualization resources: Matplotlib and Seaborn.
#### Learn.co material:

#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:

#### Learning goals for this lesson:
- SWBAT Describe different scenarious for plotting: EDA, assumption checks, results, technical notebooks, decks
- SWBAT Plot a single plot using matplotlib and identify the necessary components
- SWBAT Use the fig, ax = subplot() to create multiple plots
- SWBAT Describe the relationship between MPL and Seaborn
- SWBAT use seaborn to create a pairplot
- SWBAT use Seaborn in combination with subplots


#### Misconceptions:

#### Materials
These usually include things like:
- A lesson plan video example
- Student-facing code and resources (repository, README, Jupyter Notebook)
- Student-facing notes (README, slides)

## Lesson Outline:

**Step**: Problem <br/>
**Time**: [ ] min

_Goal/Scenario:_<br/>
What’s a real world problem where the students could apply these methods in the future. Where do you start the narrative arc of this training? What is the hook that is tied to a scenario. This could also be thought of as the “problem statement”.

_Learning Goals in sequence:_<br/>
What are the objectives, or steps students will need to do in order to achieve the goal or solve the problem?



**Step**: Activation <br/>
**Time**: [ ] min

Activity or discussion that references previous learning that connects to this new material. How do you frame this new material in the context of what they already know or what they have previously experienced or read about?


**Step**: Learning Goal 1: SWBAT Describe different scenarious for plotting: EDA, assumption checks, results, technical notebooks, decks<br/>
**Time**: [ ] min

_Demonstrate_: <br/>
Write what you’ll do to show this to students. This is the show/tell section. Perhaps discussion prompts will go here or other scripted sections along with sample code to be referenced.

_Application_: <br/>
Students alter some of the tags and refresh to see changes
Recreate alterations for the class and ask questions

_Informal assessment_: <br/>
Poll the class, think/pair/share, etc.
How will you know that all your students are ready to move on?


> **Repeat learning goal steps for remaining learning goals**

**Step**: Integration:  <br/>
**Time**: [ ] min

_Synthesis_: <br/>
Review learning goal steps that led to this final step to confirm understanding of how the steps fit together.

_Application_: <br/>
Apply these steps to now solve the entire problem posed in the beginning. If the problem has been solved through the steps, perhaps apply the same sequence of steps to a NEW scenario.


**Step**: Assessment:  <br/>
**Time**: [ ] min

Review questions? Diagnostic activity? Poll? Quiz? How will you know they synthesized everything together? Test for understanding.

**Step**: Reflection:  <br/>
**Time**: [ ] min

Small reflection of reaction to training. Will provide  bank of these questions on teacher training wiki.
